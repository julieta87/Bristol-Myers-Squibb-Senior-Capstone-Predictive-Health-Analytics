# Bristol Myers Squibb Senior Capstone: Predictive Health Analytics

Team Members: Julieta Caroppo, Zoe Hack, Joshua Richter

Sponsor: Bristol Myers Squibb

Dates: Sep 2023 â€“ May 2024

## Project Overview:

This project, sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), explored how wearable device data can be used to predict patient-reported fatigue which is a critical aspect of quality of life (QoL) in clinical trials.
Since quality of life is often subjective, our goal was to build objective, data-driven models that capture fatigue and wellness patterns using physiological signals such as: 

1. Heart rate (HR) & heart rate variability (HRV)

2.  Respiration rate (RESP)

3. Step counts & activity levels

4. Energy expenditure & skin temperature

We combined these continuous metrics with daily self-reported fatigue surveys to engineer predictive features and evaluate model performance.
